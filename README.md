# Monochrome Symphony

## Overview
Monochrome Symphony is a generative art project that creates evolving black-and-white patterns using sinusoidal and cosine functions. The animation captures the rhythmic interplay of waves and light, producing mesmerizing, flowing visuals.

## Features
- Uses **sin** and **cos** functions to create complex patterns.
- Dynamically updates over time using **Matplotlib's FuncAnimation**.
- Adjustable parameters for resolution, animation speed, and intensity.
- Inspired by **Op Art** and **generative digital art**.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the following command in a Python environment that supports Jupyter Notebooks:

```bash
jupyter notebook Monochrome_Symphony.ipynb
```

Alternatively, you can execute the script as a standalone Python program.

## Customization
You can modify parameters in the `generate_moving_art_fast` function:
- `width` and `height` control the resolution of the animation.
- `frames` sets the duration of the animation.
- `intensity` modifies the contrast and depth of the patterns.

## Example Output
The animation showcases ever-changing monochrome wave patterns, reminiscent of optical illusions.

## Inspiration
- **Op Art (Optical Art):** Inspired by geometric and wave-based designs like those of **Bridget Riley**.
- **Generative Digital Art:** Algorithmic art using mathematical functions to produce visually engaging outputs.
